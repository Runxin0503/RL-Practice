# Reinforcement Learning Examples

This project provides simple implementations of the example reinforcement learning (RL) problems presented in the video series ["Reinforcement Learning By the Book" by Mutual Information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFo9v_yKQXA&list=PLzvYlJMoZ02Dxtwe-MmH4nOB5jYlMGBjr). 

These implementations were created as part of my personal learning journey to explore the fundamentals of RL. The goal was to gain a deeper understanding of key RL concepts and algorithms like value iteration, Q-learning, and policy gradients through hands-on coding.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

```git
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. **Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA**:
- Open IntelliJ and select "Open" to open the project directory.

3. **Set up Maven**:
- IntelliJ should automatically detect the `pom.xml` file. If not, you can manually import the Maven project.

4. **Build the project**:
- In IntelliJ, go to the "Maven" tool window (on the right side) and click the "Reload All Maven Projects" button to download the dependencies.

5. **Run the examples**:
- Navigate to the main class for the desired RL problem, right-click, and choose "Run" to execute the example.

6. **Modify and experiment**:
- Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different parameters and observe how the RL algorithms perform!


## Conclusion

This project is mainly for educational purposes and reflects my experience learning about reinforcement learning. I hope it can help others who are also starting to explore this field.
